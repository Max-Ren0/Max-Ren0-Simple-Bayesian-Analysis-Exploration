# Simple Bayesian Analysis Exploration

A Shiny-based interface to simplify the use of the [`Bolstad`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Bolstad) package for introductory Bayesian statistics.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Make Bayesian analysis more accessible to undergraduate students by:
- Providing an intuitive web interface for Bolstad package functions.
- Allowing users to **draw their own prior distributions** interactively.
- Automatically normalizing and validating user-drawn priors.
- Visualizing the **posterior** based on user-defined or Beta priors.

## 🔧 Technologies

- **R**, **Shiny**
- Optional integration with `Bolstad` package
- Deployed via [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io)
- Version controlled with **GitHub**

## 📦 Output

- A user-friendly **Shiny web app** for teaching Bayesian statistics.
- Source code available in this repository.
- A written report/dissertation describing the tool and implementation.

## 👨‍🏫 Supervisor

- Dr. James Curran, Department of Statistics
